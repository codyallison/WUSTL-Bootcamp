## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. year over year the amount of successful campaigns vs failed campaigns was basically even, but successful had a slight margin over failed campaigns. However, starting in 2017 you can see the amount of successful campaigns jump in 67% of the total campaigns, which continues to hold successful campaigns of at least ~60% through the remaining years of data that is available in this data set.
2. As for which month you start a campaign in, there does not seem to be a trend to say that any one month has a correlation to being more successful, than other months.   
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The campaigns that seem to have to most consistent succesess lie in the range of $15,000 to $30,000. after that point successes decline especially after the $45,000 goal mark

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set does not contain ALL kickstarted campaigns. It does not tell us which sites these campaigns come from, kickstarter alone boasts 586,000 campaigns on their own site. https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats and so our data set of 1,000 campaigns is a small fraction of just one site. Additionally, the categories seem to be limited to art and technology. There are likely all sorts of other categories that are not being considered. household/consumer goods, toys, etc. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I created a box and whisker  chart with the backer count distribution of successful and failed campaigns, both of these showed a high degree of variability and a data set that had many backer counts in the outlier range based on the information provided. additionally i made a scatter plot chart comparing the average donation to the backer count. This relationship largely showed that i backer count was low there was a wide range of average donations ranging from just above $20 to above $100. as the average backer count went up, instances of higher average donation began to be less frequent.
